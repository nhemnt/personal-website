    "text": "“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Hemant. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Hemant for the past 2 years. He is one of the most dedicated professionals I’ve worked with and is willing to go the extra mile to help you when needed. His expertise as a React.js developer is considerable and it helped our team to come up with more efficient solutions and develop different projects. I rarely come across real talents who stand out like Hemant. Hemant’s ability to handle multiple projects was unlike any I’ve seen before and made a dramatic increase in the productivity level of our company. No matter how tense a meeting, he made sure everyone left with a smile. Hemant would be a true asset for any organization and comes with my heartfelt recommendation.",
